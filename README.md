NOTE:  This is a reimplimintation of firefox 24s on page submit method.  Creates a serease of conditionals based on any user event that could signify the page has changed,  if it has it uploads all keystrokes to mlab server.
This runs as injected javascript into each tab, meening page inspection does not reveal any code.  WHY??? hehehe.  A challenge.  The general consense was that this couldn't be done, or at least couldn't be done securly.
This extension is published on the chrome webstore meaning it has gone up for review by google, been deamed not detrimental to end user experience, and been signed by them.
Because its signed one could install it via reg key from user space outside of chrome.  Gotta love windows.  This would also sit nicly in any browser space on a library computer one forgot to log out from.
Please read instructions for warning / usage.
